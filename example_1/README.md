Our first example is writing a package that taking one custom message, and giving another custom message.

We have a package "meturone_egitim", with a custom message that gives a random array in topic "dummy_topic". 
The other examples take this array, and do same basic processing. Then give output as another custom topic, namely "answer".â‚º
